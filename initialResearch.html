<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

                <p>The fast fashion industry mistreats and exploits its workers, and workers aren’t paid living wages, they’re constantly abused, and they work in sweatshop-like conditions. </p>

              <p>There needs to be more awareness of the fast fashion industry in order for people to stop buying from these companies that support sweatshop-like working conditions so the industry can lose support and more ethical and sustainable companies can be supported.

          <li>The fast fashion industry is continuously violating human rights by exploiting workers from developing and underserved countries, employing children, and forcing them to work in sweatshops. Alex Assoune (MS), Chief Executive Officer of Panaprium, a sustainable fashion brand, states that “the fast fashion industry exploits local and underserved communities in sweatshops to produce cheap garments.” </li>

      <div class="col">
        <ul>
          <li>Most of the workers who create the clothes consist of children and women who are often abused. Women face harassment, abuse, and sexual assault when in the workplace. Alex Assoune states that, “many young women work in garments factories, being sexually abused, and forced to abort their pregnancy.”</li>

      <div class="col">
        <ul>
          <li>Workers are forced to work in sweatshops which expose them to dangerous chemicals. They can be exposed to pesticides which can cause depression, seizures, headaches, or loss of consciousness. Workers are forced to work long hours in these conditions prolonging their exposure to dangerous chemicals. </li>
