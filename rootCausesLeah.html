                    <li>An increased demand in clothing leads to companies needing a higher and faster production rate, and they need more employees to create garments.</li>

                    <li>"It is a paradox that consumers, despite their awareness of sustainability and ethical challenges facing in the current
                    society, still develop a positive attitude toward fast fashion brands. "</li>

                    <li>This means that consumers will still buy from fast fashion companies despite knowing the horrible situations behind the cheap clothing. This is very significant because it shows that people are aware of the situations.</li>
